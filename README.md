# heart-failure-prediction-classification

This is the third data product for my university course.  
It's aim is to predict heart failure based on a number of parameters, using classification.  
  
To run it, you need a working python environment capable of handling Juptyer Notebooks.  
If that's given, simply clone the repo and open the .ipynb file.  
If you don't want to run it, a version of the notebook with the outputs is saved in the .html file.
  
__Please note that this project wasn't version controlled__, due to it's Jupyter Notebook format.
